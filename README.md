# General
This repository analyzes data gathered by
 [Garner, Zanic, and coworkers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037). In
 their experiment, they find and analyze microtubule catastrophe times for
 labeled and unlabeled samples. They also gathered catastriphe times for differing
 concentrations of tubulin.

# Dataset
The datasets can be downloaded from 
**[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/gardner_time_to_catastrophe_dic_tidy.csv)** and
**[here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/gardner_mt_catastrophe_only_tubulin.csv)**.
Put it into a separate data folder in the main repository. That is where
the walkthrough looks to grab it from.

# Package
To install the package used in this, navigate to the `software_module` folder
on your command line.
Then, type `pip install -e microtubule_analysis`. The package should be installed,
and you can proceed with the walkthrough!
