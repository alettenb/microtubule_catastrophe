  Microtubule Catastrophe Analysis

  Alex Lettenberger, Kevin Yu, and Theo Yang
Abstract: >
  In this analysis, we use data gathered by 
  [Garner, Zanic, and coworkers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037) to 
  fit a distribution to microtubule catastrophe. We first find that labeling
  microtubules does not make a significant differenc in catastrophe time. 
  Next, we find and derive two distributions to fit to microtubule catastrophe:
  the Gamma Distribution and the 2 Poisson Process Distribution. The latter
  distribution is created by two Poisson processes occurring after one another.
  We then use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate parameters for both of
  these distributions, and we find that the Gamma Distribution is a better
  fit for microtubule catastrophe. Using the Gamma Distribution, we estimate the
  number and rate of events under varying concentations of tubulin. 
  We find that the rate of events causing catastrophe is lower given a 
  higher rate of polymerization, caused by higher concentrations of 
  tubulin.
Summary:  >
  Our analysis can be found at [this link](code). The GitHub repository
  containing all of our results is located [here](https://github.com/alettenb/microtubule_catastrophe).
  In our analysis, we first use confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
  to determine that labeled and unlabeled microtubules do not have significantly
  different distributions. We assume that microtubule is caused by events
  that each follow a Poisson Process, and
  we then look at two possible distributions for
  microtubule catastrophe that follow this story. These two distributions are
  the Gamma Distribution, where we can have an arbitrary number of Poisson 
  Processes that all have the same rate, and the 2 Poisson Process Distribution,
  where we can only have two events, but they can have different rates. We 
  analytically find the PDF for the 2 Poisson Process Distribution, and we 
  empirically find an ECDF to verify that the analytical CDF is correct. Then,
  we use MLE to estimate the parameters for both the Gamma and 2 Poisson Process
  distributions. Using AIC and Q-Q plots, we find that the Gamma Distribution
  better characterizes microtubule catastrophe. Using MLE with the Gamma 
  Distributions and various concentrations of tubulin, we find that
  faster polymerization leads to a lower rate of events that cause catastrophe.
